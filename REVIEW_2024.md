# Project Review 2024

This update expands on the original `REVIEW.md` after examining the current codebase and running the test suite.

## Highlights
- The project remains lightweight and easy to run directly in the browser.
- Use of a shared `Scoreboard` promotes consistent scoring across games.

## Suggestions for Further Improvement
1. **Testing Dependencies**
   - Running `npm test` fails because Jest isn't installed. Adding `jest` to `devDependencies` and committing a `package-lock.json` would ensure tests run reliably.

2. **Modularization**
   - Multiple challenge scripts replicate logic for loading word lists and updating the scoreboard. Consolidating these patterns in utility modules would reduce duplication.

3. **Offline Support**
   - Fetch operations assume network availability. Consider bundling the word lists and providing fallbacks when offline.

4. **Tooling**
   - Introduce a linter (e.g., ESLint) to keep the JavaScript code style consistent.

5. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Include a section in the README that demonstrates running tests and explains the purpose of each challenge. Screenshots would also help newcomers understand the gameplay.

These improvements would streamline maintenance while making the games more robust for learners.
