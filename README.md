## Running Tests

The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing. To install dependencies and run the tests:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

The tests are located under the `tests/` directory and cover helper functions
from the various challenge scripts such as `createIncompleteWord` and `shuffle`.
