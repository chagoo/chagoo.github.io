# Project Review 2025

This review looks at the repository after the latest updates in 2025. The games remain easy to launch in the browser and now include small improvements such as transitions and a unified scoring system.

## Highlights
- Shared utilities (`utils.js`) eliminate duplicate code and provide a carousel helper.
- Score tracking persists in `localStorage` via `scoreboard.js` and is visible in the menu.
- Animations for card flips and word loads make interactions smoother.
- Navigation links on the menu page help jump between challenges quickly.

## Suggestions for Further Improvement
1. **Testing Setup**
   - The project still requires installing Jest manually. Including `jest` in `package.json` and committing a lock file would streamline running `npm test`.
2. **Build Process**
   - Consider using a simple bundler to combine scripts and styles. This would reduce repeated `<script>` tags and allow ES module syntax.
3. **Accessibility**
   - Add ARIA attributes to buttons and ensure keyboard navigation works across all games.
4. **Documentation**
   - Expand the README with brief descriptions and screenshots of each challenge.

These steps would continue to polish the project while keeping it beginner friendly.
